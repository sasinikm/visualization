# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
    ```

    Accessible - Colors used in the visualization are not too bright and are accesible for color blind audience. Font sizes used for numerical values are large and clear but text size is bit small. Text is embedded in images so might not be readable by screen readers. 

    Reproducible - As this is an ongoing project data sources are not shared with the visialization, but as only 20 data points are required to create the bar graph, any one can manually create a dataset and generate the graph ,but how the environmental impact is calculated is not mentioned, hence these values are not reporoducible. 

    Equitable  - Anyone can acces this visualization publicly via Tableu public visualizations. Environmental impact is a sensitive topic for different audiences. Though this visualization is neutral making sure the message conveyed tallys with cultural perspective of the targeted audience is accepted. 

    Bad Visualization: https://dribbble.com/shots/21955628-Bar-chart-widgets-Hyper-charts-UI-Kit

    Accessible - Colors used in the visualization are too bright so it might be hard for colour sensitive people to look at the graphs for a longer time. Colors used for some text are difficult to read due to lack of color contrast ("Compared to $..pharses"). Font sizes of data labels in the graph are small. Missing axis labels and title is challenging for audiences to understand the visualization.

    Reproducible - This graph is not reproducible as the data source  or software used is not mentioned. Also as there is no title and description it lacks clarity. Hence it is hard to reproduce it even with a manually created dataset.

    Equitable  - This visualization is accesible publicly for everyone using above link. 

    ```
- How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
    ```
    Good Visualization: Dreamforce 2019 Water Bottle Refills
    * Increasing the font size of the text will help to improve the readability.
    * Adding Alt+text will help visually imapred audience to get an idea of the visualaization.
    * Checking whether the text in the visulazation is screen readable and if not adding it as a text without embedding in an image.
    * Sharing a data source and mentioning the methods used to calculate the environmental impact using additional notes would improve the reproducibility and transperency of the visualization.

    Bad Visualization:
    * Using less bright colours and using contrasting colours for text will improve the accessability.
    * Adding a title and axis lables will increase the clarity and improve the accessability. 
    * Indicating the data source and softwares will improve the reproducibility of the visualization. 
    * Adding Alt+text will help visually imapred audience to get an idea of the visualaization.

    ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story

### Rubric:
